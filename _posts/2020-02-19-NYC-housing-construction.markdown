I happened across this tweet today, showing YTD housing additions to the NYC market for the last few years. 

<div class="center">

But with only a month and a half gone so far this year, it seems a bit strange to be reading too much into this data. But with this data publicly available from the [NYC department of buildings](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Certificate-Of-Occupancy/bs8b-p36w), it should be easy to take a quick look at the data to see what is going on.

A quick look at housing production over the last few years show some seasonal variability but it has been pretty consistent in adding 2000 units per month for the last three years. The dip in the current month's housing production looks similar enough to previous dips that I would not be concerned that it presents a meaningful difference compared to the status quo.

But when breaking it down by Borough, we can see that the housing production in manhattan has been dropping for the last \~6 months while some of the other boroughs have started to pick up the pace. While Manhattan had recently regained it's position atop the housing production chart, brooklyn has been siginificantly ahead for the past few months. Meanwhile, staten island appears to be adding no significant amount of housing compared to the other four boroughs.

Council members have a lot of power in determining whether housing gets built in their districts. Looking at housing production by councilmember for Queens and Manhattan shows how much power council members have - only three councilmembers have allowed significant construction to occur in their districts.

With the city declining in population due to decreases in family size in similarly sized apartments, the city should be doing more than producing ~25000 housing units every year. NYC provides a great economic opportunity to many people, and could be providing great opportunities to even more people if it were willing to grow as it did in the beginning of the 20th century, when it was adding over 100k residents per year.
