With Covid19 being the only thing in the news these days, I figured it would be good to take a look at the two cities/states that had the earliest outbreaks in the US: Washington and New York. New York and Washington both hit their 100th case of corona virus on March 8th, but have taken drastically different paths since then.

Here we can see what happens when social distancing starts only a few days earlier. In Seattle and elsewhere in Washington State, school closures began on March 12th, while they did not begin until the 17th in NYC. School closures are not the only proceedure attempted by cities to promote social distancing, but should serve as a good proxy for when cities began implementing serious city closures.

Praise has been given to NY Governor Andrew Cuomo for his response to the coronovirus epidemic, but there appears from this data to be serious concerns that NY waited too long to implement serious 'Stay At Home' proceedures until the virus had spread quite far within the NY population, which has serious consequences for a state with the largest city in the country.

One reason for the difference in responses may have been due to the difference in deaths in both places early on. In Washington, a senior facility was hit first with covid19. Since seniors are particularly susceptible to Covid19, a large portion of Washington's early cases unfortunately resulted in deaths. But, this may have jolted the state and local governments into more urgent action, thereby saving lives down the line.

I also took a look a closer look at data in King County, WA to see if we can pinpoint dates at which the school closure started helping. The incubation period for Covid-19 is between 2 and 11 days, so hopefully improvements should be visible after this date range.

This data appears pretty noisy, and it is not so easy to conclude anything particularly useful from this data. Now that King County is reporting when tests occured, we can see that reports to county officials are arriving around one day after the tests have been done, which is quite fast compared to earlier reports of tests taking multiple days to a week to run.
